# etch-a-sketch_v2
Re-visit of etch-a-sketch from TOP

Previous build can be found here: https://github.com/al-uminium/etch-a-sketch

v2 has more concise JS (I hope) when it comes to creating elements, and what I feel to be a sleeker design. 
I didn't implement the slider bar from v1 as I felt that it didn't fit into the aesthetic, so there's a lost of functionality there 
(you wouldn't know what's the min or max, unless you experiment around and find the errors)

All in all, it's a good exercise.
